The goal of this project is:
  * Explore the possibilities of Heroku with a JSF Primefaces Java App
  * Create a template for prototype Java App in a quick way.
  
Here is the data we need if in some occasion you want to show a short PoC regarding Heroku, JEE6 App and Heroku Connect. The functionality is very simple; CRUD operations for Entity Airline in both ways, 
from Salesforce to Heroku and from Heroku to Salesforce.

Saleforce Org: 
https://cunning-panda-7i6nwn-dev-ed.lightning.force.com
User: ignramgar@cunning-panda-7i6nwn.com
Pwd: l7PbHJJgUQuTiMdvGGJz.

Maybe Salesforce requests a code to verify the account, just ping me and I will tell you while I find the way to disable (apparently there is a way but as my org is also a free org, maybe I do not have this option).

Actions:
•	Select tab airlines
•	Select view “Airline view”  in order to see the fields that have been selected to sync.

Heroku JEE app:
https://herokuamd.herokuapp.com/

Select the menu item “CRUD Operations”

Now you can sync crud operation in both Salesforce and JEE Heroku app. According to Heroku, as we have a free account, it sync in a max of 10 min but I have seen that it is done in just 1 or 2 seconds.

Next steps when we have the time:

1.	Authentication through Azure. Luisfer will manage the permission to do it.
